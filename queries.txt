Part 2:
  Make the index:

  psql:
    Index on onePercent:
      CREATE TEMP TABLE TMP AS SELECT * FROM HUNDREDKTUP WHERE onePercent = 1;
      CREATE TEMP TABLE TMP AS SELECT * FROM ONEMTUP WHERE onePercent = 1;
      CREATE TEMP TABLE TMP AS SELECT * FROM TENMTUP WHERE onePercent = 1;
    No index:
      CREATE TEMP TABLE TMP AS SELECT * FROM HUNDREDKTUP WHERE two = 1;
      CREATE TEMP TABLE TMP AS SELECT * FROM ONEMTUP WHERE two = 1;
      CREATE TEMP TABLE TMP AS SELECT * FROM TENMTUP WHERE two = 1;
  Sqlite:
    Index on onePercent:
      CREATE TABLE TMP AS SELECT * FROM HUNDREDKTUP WHERE onePercent = 1;
      CREATE TABLE TMP AS SELECT * FROM ONEMTUP WHERE onePercent = 1;
      CREATE TABLE TMP AS SELECT * FROM TENMTUP WHERE onePercent = 1;
    No Index:
      CREATE TABLE TMP AS SELECT * FROM HUNDREDKTUP WHERE two = 1;
      CREATE TABLE TMP AS SELECT * FROM ONEMTUP WHERE two = 1;
      CREATE TABLE TMP AS SELECT * FROM TENMTUP WHERE two = 1;
Part 3:
  psql:
    CREATE TEMP TABLE TMP AS SELECT t1.unique1 FROM HUNDREDKTUP t1, HUNDREDKTUP t2 WHERE t1.unique1 = t2.unique2;
    CREATE TEMP TABLE TMP AS SELECT t1.unique1 FROM ONEMTUP t1, ONEMTUP t2 WHERE t1.unique1 = t2.unique2;
    CREATE TEMP TABLE TMP AS SELECT t1.unique1 FROM TENMTUP t1, TENMTUP t2 WHERE t1.unique1 = t2.unique2;
  Sqlite:
    CREATE TABLE TMP AS SELECT t1.unique1 FROM HUNDREDKTUP t1, HUNDREDKTUP t2 WHERE t1.unique1 = t2.unique2;
    CREATE TABLE TMP AS SELECT t1.unique1 FROM ONEMTUP t1, ONEMTUP t2 WHERE t1.unique1 = t2.unique2;
    CREATE TABLE TMP AS SELECT t1.unique1 FROM TENMTUP t1, TENMTUP t2 WHERE t1.unique1 = t2.unique2;
Part 4:
  psql:
    CREATE TEMP TABLE TMP AS SELECT t1.unique1 FROM TENMTUP t1, TENMTUP t2 WHERE (t1.tenPercent = 2) AND (t1.unique1 = t2.unique2);
    SET enable_mergejoin TO FALSE;
    SET enable_hashjoin TO FALSE;
  Sqlite:
    CREATE TABLE TMP AS SELECT t1.unique1 FROM TENMTUP t1, TENMTUP t2 WHERE (t1.tenPercent = 2) AND (t1.unique1 = t2.unique2);
